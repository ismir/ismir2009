      <h1>Call for Papers</h1>
      <div class="paragraph">
<h2>Celebrating The 10th Anniversary:<br />Increasing Diversity And Toward The Future</h2>
The 10th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference
will take place October 26-30, 2009 (Monday through
Friday), in Kobe, Japan.  Looking at the recent rapid growth of ISMIR
conferences since its inception in 2000 and the expansion of the music
information retrieval (MIR) community, MIR people may no longer
consider acronym MIR as "music information retrieval" in the strict
sense, but rather think that MIR essentially fits "music information
research" in a broad sense.  Correspondingly, MIR also draws
considerable attention from other research/application fields.  ISMIR
therefore aims to open a new horizon of the exchange and discussion of
ideas, issues, results, and perspectives for people of widespread
areas, such as representatives of academia, industry, entertainment,
and education, including researchers, developers, educators,
librarians, students, and professional users.  Alongside presentations
of original theoretical research and practical work, ISMIR provides
introductory and in-depth tutorials, and a venue for the showcase of
current MIR-related products and systems.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
To foster MIR, every time previous ISMIR was held, we have been making
attempts and learning from experiences.  New changes would be introduced
to ISMIR 2009, while some effective part of ISMIR 2008 would be
inherited with minor revisions.  What are inherited from ISMIR 2008
include:
<ul>
<li>Rebuttal phase during paper selection,</li>
<li>Uniform paper status for all accepted submissions, and</li>
<li>Late breaking / demo session.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
The topic areas and the emphasis on higher quality and wider
interdisciplinary research and scholarship in all aspects of MIR
remain unchanged.  Novel and previously unpublished submissions are
solicited in areas including, but not limited to, the following:
<ul>
<li>content-based querying and retrieval</li>
<li>database systems, indexing, and query</li>
<li>fingerprinting and digital rights management</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>transcription and annotation</li>
<li>music signal processing</li>
<li>score following and audio alignment</li>
<li>optical music recognition</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>melody and motives</li>
<li>rhythm, beat, tempo, and form</li>
<li>harmony, chords, and tonality</li>
<li>timbre, instrumentation and voice</li>
<li>performance analysis</li>
<li>modification and transformation of music data</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>computational musicology</li>
<li>perception and cognition</li>
<li>emotion and aesthetics</li>
<li>applications of MIR to the performing arts and multimedia</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>automatic classification</li>
<li>genre, style, and mood</li>
<li>similarity metrics</li>
<li>music summarization</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>user interfaces and user models</li>
<li>music recommendation and playlist generation</li>
<li>text and web mining</li>
<li>knowledge representation, social tags, and metadata</li>
<li>libraries, archives and digital collections</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>evaluation and annotation issues</li>
<li>methodological and philosophical issues</li>
<li>social, legal, ethical, and business issues</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
In addition to research papers, we also solicit late-breaking / demo
submissions, and proposals for tutorials, and exhibits.  More details
on each category are provided below.
</div>
<div class="border"></div>
<h2>Contribution requirements and guidelines</h2>
<h3>1. Papers</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
All papers will be peer-reviewed according to their novelty, technical
content, presentation, and contribution to the overall balance of
topics and disciplines represented at ISMIR 2009. Papers that
introduce new topics and methods to MIR research are particularly
welcome. Paper submissions should satisfy the following conditions:
<ul>
<li>Formatting must comply to the guidelines and templates that will be
available on the submission web page (<a href="submission/index.html">http://ismir2009.ismir.net/submission/</a> 
will be open in early-January).</li>
<li>Submitted papers must be between 4 and 6 pages long.</li>
<li>Papers should include a 150-200 word abstract.</li>
<li>Submission must consist of original contributions (not previously
published and not currently being considered for publication
elsewhere).</li>
<li>There is no limitation on the number of submissions per author.</li>
<li>The rebuttal phase will take place during June 26th - July 3rd.</li>
<li>Accepted papers will be designated either as poster-only
presentations, or as oral talks without poster presentations. </li>
<li>Authors of accepted papers will be asked to provide camera-ready
copies of their papers.</li>
<li>If accepted, authors are encouraged to bring laptop computers or
other appropriate equipment to supplement their presentations.</li>
<li>For each accepted paper, at least one author must register for the
ISMIR 2009 conference prior to submission of the camera-ready version.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h4>Uniform paper status:</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
There will be no submission categories of papers.  Judgement of
acceptance will be made based purely on the paper quality relative to
the other papers; all accepted papers will be allotted up to six
pages in the proceedings.  Although authors can indicate preference
for oral or poster presentation upon submission, the program
committee will decide the most effective way of presenation (oral
presentation or poster presentation) based on the nature of the paper
and interest to the broader MIR community as well as scheduling
constraints.  The presentation format has no relation to the reviewer
judgment of paper quality and will be determined after the acceptance
judgement.  Poster authors are expected to give a 30-second
presentation of their work as part of the "madness" session before
each poster session.
</div>
<h4>Awards:</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
ISMIR 2009 will have the best paper award, the best student paper
award, and the presentation award (new).  The presentation award will
have two subcategories, oral and poster, which will be selected by
votes collected during the conference.
</div>

<h3>2. Late-breaking / demo submissions</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
A special session during the ISMIR 2009 schedule 
(the morning of October 30) will be dedicated to:<br />
<ul class="latinlist">
<li>the presentation of preliminary results and ideas that are not yet fully formed 
nor systematically evaluated; and</li>
<li>the demonstration of applications that are of interest to the MIR community.</li>
</ul>

These late-breaking / demo submissions will not be reviewed and 
will not be included in the proceedings of the conference. 
Thus, they have been assigned a late deadline (August 31 24:00 (JST)). 
</div>
<div class="paragraph">

For submission, please upload to 
<a href = "https://www.softconf.com/a/ismir09-lbd"> 
the online submission system </a>
an A4 one-page PDF file containing the title, author(s) and affiliation(s), and
an abstract outlining the work to be presented.  
Figures and tables may be included if necessary.  
The PDF files will be published online, 
but will not be included in the ISMIR 2009 proceedings. 
If the number of submissions exceeds the size dictated 
by the available presentation space, submissions that contribute 
to a balanced session will be given priority. 
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
If the confirmation of the presentation to be made at the conference
is necessary before the deadline of early registration
(August 10), please submit your PDF file and let me know it a.s.a.p.
</div>
<h3>3. Tutorials</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
The first day of the conference (October 26) will consist of
a parallel session of tutorials each concentrating on a single topic
presented either at an introductory level or in depth, lasting about
3 hours (including a break). Submissions should consist of a 1-4 page
abstract including:
<ul>
<li>Title</li>
<li>Outline of the tutorial content</li>
<li>Intended and expected audience</li>
<li>Short biography of the presenter(s)</li>
<li>Any special requirements</li>
<li>Contact information</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
The document should be sent as a pdf attachment via email to
<img src="images/mail_tutorials.png" alt="E-mail address" />
by January 31, 2009.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
Acceptance/rejection decisions will be made by the ISMIR 2009 Conference
Committee. The decision will depend on the criteria including
relevance, suitability, originality, and expertise of the
presenter(s).  Acceptance/rejection of a proposal will be noticed
before February 28, 2009.
</div>
<h3>4. Exhibits and Bookstore</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
Throughout ISMIR 2009, space will be available for publishers,
software companies, booksellers, service providers, system vendors,
and any other businesses interested in exhibiting their MIR-related
products. They are invited to contact the program committee via email
to
<img src="images/mail_exhibits.png" alt="E-mail address"/>
regarding the ISMIR bookstore and/or
exhibition space before August 31.

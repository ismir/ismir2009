<h3>Abstract:</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
The International Symposium on Music Information Retrieval (ISMIR) was born on 13 August 1999.
This invited paper expresses the opinions of three of ISMIR's founders as they reflect upon what has happened during its first decade.
The paper provides the background context for the events that led to the establishment of ISMIR.
We highlight the first ISMIR, held in Plymouth, MA in October of 2000,
and use it to elucidate key trends that have influenced subsequent ISMIRs.
Indicators of growth and success drawn from ISMIR publication data are pre-sented.
The role that the Music Information Retrieval Evaluation eXchange (MIREX) has played at ISMIR is also examined.
The factors contributing to ISMIR's growth and success are enumerated.
The paper concludes with a set of challenges and opportunities that the newly formed
International Society for Music Information Retrieval should embrace
to ensure the future vitality of the conference series and the ISMIR community.

<div class="paragraph">
Donald Byrd studied music composition at Indiana University in the late 1960's,
and then became interested in computers and their potential to help musicians.
After spending a number of years as a programmer and consultant at the University's academic computing support services,
he received a PhD in Computer Science with a dissertation on music notation by computer.
Since then, He has worked extensively both in industry and academia.
He was one of the principal sound designers and sound-design software developers for the Kurzweil 250,
arguably the first synthesizer to reproduce sounds of acoustic instruments convincingly.
He was also the principal designer of the influential music-notation program Nightingale.
His academic background includes research on music notation by computer (at Princeton University);
work on information retrieval in text, especially visualization and human/computer interaction aspects
(at the University of Massachusetts); and work on music information retrieval, digital music libraries,
and optical music recognition (at the University of Massachusetts and Indiana University).
Most recently, he has been working on the "General Temporal Workbench," a timeline-based system for visualizing,
exploring, creating, and "playing" temporal phenomena:
a system general enough for use on any timescale from fractions of an attosecond to billions of years.
He is currently senior scientist and adjunct associate professor in the School of Informatics at IU.

<h3>Abstract:</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
Even though the market size is still small at this moment,
applied fields of robots are gradually spreading from the manufacturing industry to the others in recent years.
One can now easily expect that applications of robots will expand into the first and the third industrial fields
as one of the important components to support our society in the 21st century.
There also raises strong anticipations in Japan that robots for the personal use will coexist with humans
and provide supports such as the assistance for the housework, care of the aged and the physically handicapped,
since Japan is one the fastest aging societies in the world.
Consequently, humanoid robots and/or animaloid robots have been treated as subjects of robotics researches in Japan
such as a research tool for human/animal science, an entertainment/mental-commit robot or an assistant/agent for humans
in the human living environment.
Over the last couple of years, some manufactures including famous global companies started to develop prototypes
or even to sell mass production robots for the purposes mentioned above, such as HONDA, TOYOTA, Mitsubishi Heavy, TMSUK, etc.
On the other hand, Waseda University, where the author belongs to,
has been one of the leading research sites on humanoid robot research
since the late Prof. Ichiro Kato and his colleagues started the WABOT (WAseda roBOT) Projects
and developed the historical humanoid robots that were WABOT-1 and WABOT-2 in the early 70s and 80s respectively.
One of the most important aspects of our research philosophy is as follows:
By constructing anthropomorphic/humanoid robots that functions and behaves like a human,
we are attempting to develop the design method of humanoid robots to coexist with humans naturally and symbiotically,
as well as to scientifically build not only the physical model of a human but also its mental model from the engineering view point.
Based upon the philosophy, I and my colleagues have been developing the flute playing humanoid robots as WF (Waseda Flutist) series
as well as the bipedal walking robots WABIAN series, the emotion expression robots WE series and the talking robots WT series, etc.
Especially, the purpose of the flute playing robot research is to build the model of the human flute play and to clarify the model
from the engineering viewpoint by reproducing the human-like flute play using a humanoid robot having the human-like respiratory
organs for the flute play. By using the robot, we become able to experimentally confirm the model of the human flute play quantitatively.
The flute playing robot/model is useful for the flute playing beginners to show how to use/move the organs or it will be used
for the evaluation of the flute instrument production in industry.
We also started the development of saxophone playing humanoid robots recently.
In my keynote talk, I will introduce the research philosophy of my humanoid robots in general by showing examples,
the technical aspects of the wind instrument playing humanoid robots and the other humanoid robots related to music.

<h3>Biography</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
Atsuo Takanishi is a Professor of the Department of Modern Mechanical
Engineering, Waseda University and a concurrent Professor and one of the core
members of the HRI (Humanoid Robotics Institute), Waseda University. He received
the B.S.E. degree in 1980, the M.S.E. degree in 1982 and the Ph.D. degree in
1988, all in Mechanical Engineering from Waseda University.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
His current researches are related to Humanoid Robots and its applications in
medicine and well-being, such as the biped walking robots for modeling human
biped walking as WABIAN (WAseda BIpedal humANoid) series, the biped locomotors
for carrying handicapped or elders as WL (Waseda Leg) series, the mastication
robots WJ (Waseda Jaw) series to mechanically simulate human mastication for
clarifying the hypotheses in dentistry, the jaw opening-closing trainer robots
WY (Waseda Yamanashi) series for patients having difficulties in jaw opening or
closing, the flute-playing robots as WF (Waseda Flutist) series and the
saxophone-playing robots WS (Waseda Saxophonist) series to quantitatively
analyze human flute/saxophone playing by collaborating with a professional
flutists/saxophonists, and the anthropomorphic talking robots WT (Waseda Talker)
series which mechanically speak Japanese vowels and consonant sounds, and the
other robots/systems related to his research area. His interest in humanoid
robots has extended to the emotion of human that he started to develop the
emotion expression humanoid robots WE (Waseda Eye) series and KOBIAN/HABIAN
which emotionally behave like a human based upon the "Equations of Emotion." His
humanoid robot WABIAN-2R was exhibited in the 2005 World Exposition in Aichi,
Japan to demonstrate the knee extended walking using the human-like pelvis and
seven DOF leg mechanisms. The emotion expression humanoid KOBIAN is developed
based on WABIAN-2R. The latest model WL-16 carries humans and virtually any
heavy load weighing up to 80 kg. This project is aiming at developing a
practical personal vehicle which supports the society of Japan rapidly becoming
an aging society. He recently developed suture/ligature evaluation system WKS
series which shows surgeon trainees the quantitative scores of their
suture/ligature skills. This system is commercially available from a medical
model and training simulator company, Kyoto Kagaku Co. Ltd., in Japan. He is
also developing the airway management robot for anesthetist/paramedic trainees
collaborating with the company. Refer to www.takanishi.mech.waseda.ac.jp for

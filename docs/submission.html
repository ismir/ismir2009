<h1>Submission</h1>
<div class="border"></div>
<div class="paragraph">
This page describes information for authors to submit papers in ISMIR 2009.
</div>
<h2>Paper submissions</h2>
<div class="paragraph">
  <a href="https://www.softconf.com/a/ismir2009/">ISMIR 2009 online submission system</a>
</div>

<h3>1. Paper guidelines and templates:</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
Papers must be between 4 and 6 pages long.
There is no submission categories of papers. 
All accepted papers will be selected as either oral or poster presentation
by the program committee.
Format your paper in PDF format according to one of the following templates:
<ul class="nonelist">
<li><a href="data/ISMIR2009TemplateLatex_rev2.zip">ISMIR 2009 LaTeX Template Package</a> <span style="color: red">(Updated)</span></li>
<li>(The LaTeX template package was updated on May 8th.
The specification of reference order was corrected in the style file.
This would not affect your paper layout.)</li>
<li><a href="data/ISMIR2009TemplateWord.zip">ISMIR 2009 Word Template Package</a></li>
</ul>
The templates also include all the information about formatting manuscripts for ISMIR 2009.
For preparing your paper, LaTeX is strongly recommended to give the final proceedings a uniform look. 
</div>

<h3>2. Double Blind Review Policy</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
To promote fair and objective assessment of each paper, 
double-blind review will be adopted.  
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
Authors should omit their identifiers in the submission as much as
possible.  Please omit authors' names from title page (or list as
"name(s) omitted for submission"), and avoid revealing their identities
through citation.  For example, the references to previous work by the
third person would be preferable: "we extend Smith's (2007) earlier
work" rather than "we extend our earlier work."  Citations to author's
own work that are not fundamental to understanding the paper should be
excluded.  These citatins can be added in the camera-ready copy.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
In the online submission system, reviewers will not be able to see the
identity of the authors of each paper. Thus, when submitting, authors
will be asked to identify all conflicts of interest that exist between
any of the authors and any of the committee members (or other
reviewers).
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
We encourage authors to anonymize their submissions in order to follow
a double-blind review process. We, however, realize that in certain
circumstances this might not be possible due to factors such as
reporting results on well known established systems or providing web
links to multimedia material such as sounds and videos. In such cases
where the reviewing of the paper might be hindered by the
double-review policy, authors can decide to reveal their identities.  
</div>

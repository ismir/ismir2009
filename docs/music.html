<h2 id="SHAKUHACHI">Shakuhachi Concert: Komuso Shakuhachi Travels Around the World</h2>
<h3>@ International Conference Room (Tuesday, October 27, 18:00-)</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
The shakuhachi is a Japanese traditional instrument that is popular internationally.
This transverse flute with five holes made of bamboo was born as a Buddhist tool for Komuso,
the monks of Fuke sect of Zen.
The shakuhachi is connected with the sounds of the Zen spirit and its religious influence.
Therefore, its musical structure and playing style has become unique and exclusive to Japan,
which makes it an interesting instrument that you cannot find among any other instruments.
Because of the shakuhachi's characteristic sound it has been used in various genres of music
such as avant-garde music, computer music, popular music, western classical music,
ethnic music etc.
In this lecture I would like to explain the characteristics of shakuhachi music
and its history using live performances of each musical style.
The old shakuhachi called "Jinashi shakuhachi" are a minority in the shakuhachi world,
and today is a rare chance to be able to enjoy the sound of Jinashi shakuhachi,
so please enjoy.
